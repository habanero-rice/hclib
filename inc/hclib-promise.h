 *
 * NOTE: Terminology
 *   promise = an object that has data put on it, and by being put on can
 *             trigger downstream dependent tasks to execute. Promises are
 *             write-only.
 *   future  = a read-only handle to a promise's result that can be used to
 *             block on the satisfaction of that handle, or to express a task
 *             dependency on that promise.
 *   triggered task = a normal task whose execution is predicated on the
 *             satisfaction of some promise. This dependency is expressed using
 *             the future associated with that promise.
